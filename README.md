Things need discussions/opinions:

- Please proofread the texts as I modified some to fit the graphics. 

- I didn't include the result "Trails were associated with linear feature use for most taxa in at least one region or linear feature type" as I want to keep some white space to breath. --> If it's one of the key points want to be included --> I can try fitting it in the place where the conclusion is sitting now. 

- I think the first point of conclusion can be modified as the information is similar to the introduction. --> Any thoughts? 

Things will be changed in next version (growing list):

- Reduce the shadow on the bear

- Update the paper DOI

## Tools

I will be using these two platforms for designing: 

- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/): an image editor for most of the visual design, including digital drawing.

- [Canva](https://www.canva.com/): a design tool for presentations and social media. I will be using canva for the text design. 

Example of some of my previous digital drawing:
